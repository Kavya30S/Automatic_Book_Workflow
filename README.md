# Automated Book Publication Workflow  
**Your AI-Powered Book Buddyâ€”Making Book Magic Happen!**  

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Check out my *Automated Book Publication Workflow*â€”a super cool project that grabs book content from the web, jazzes it up with AI, lets me tweak it, and keeps everything organized. Itâ€™s like having a creative sidekick for book lovers or anyone curious about AI. Stick aroundâ€”Iâ€™ll break it down for you in a way thatâ€™s easy to follow and fun to read!

## Whatâ€™s This Project All About?  
Imagine youâ€™ve got a book chapter online, and you want to remix it into something fresh and awesome. Thatâ€™s where this project comes in! Hereâ€™s what it does:  
- **Grabs Stuff**: Pulls text and a screenshot from a webpage.  
- **Gets Creative**: Uses AI to rewrite and summarize it.  
- **Lets Me Edit**: I can jump in and add my own flair.  
- **Saves It**: Stores everything neatly so I can find it later.  

Itâ€™s a simple way to play with AI and booksâ€”perfect for anyone who loves a good story or tech tinkering!

## Howâ€™s It Organized? (Folder Structure)  
Iâ€™ve kept things nice and tidy so you can find everything easily. Hereâ€™s the layout:  

```bash
book_publication_workflow/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                 # Where all the cool stuff ends up
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw/              # The untouched text straight from the web
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ processed/        # AIâ€™s remixed and reviewed versions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ screenshots/      # Pictures of the webpage
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # The code that makes it all happen
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fetch_content.py  # Grabs the text and screenshot
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ai_process.py     # AI does its rewrite and review magic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storage.py        # Saves everything in a database
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ search.py         # Finds stuff I saved earlier
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # List of tools the project needs
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py               # The one file to rule them all
â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Hey, thatâ€™s this file!
```

Each folder has a job, and together they make the project run smoothly!

## What Goes In and Comes Out? (Inputs & Outputs)  
Letâ€™s talk about what I feed into this project and what it spits outâ€”itâ€™s pretty straightforward!  

### Input  
- **Just a Web Link!**: I give it a URL to a book chapter. For example:  
  `https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Gates_of_Morning/Book_1/Chapter_1`  
  Thatâ€™s it! One link, and the project takes it from there.  

### Outputs  
Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find after the project does its thing:  
- **`data/raw/chapter_1.txt`**:  
  - **What It Is**: The exact text copied from the webpage, no changes.  
  - **Why Itâ€™s There**: Itâ€™s the starting pointâ€”like the raw dough before baking!  
- **`data/processed/spun_content.txt`**:  
  - **What It Is**: The AIâ€™s fun rewrite of the text in its own words.  
  - **Why Itâ€™s There**: Itâ€™s like a fresh take on the storyâ€”new vibes, same heart!  
- **`data/processed/reviewed_content.txt`**:  
  - **What It Is**: A short summary or review of the rewritten text, also by AI.  
  - **Why Itâ€™s There**: Gives me a quick rundown of whatâ€™s newâ€”super handy!  
- **`data/screenshots/chapter_1.png`**:  
  - **What It Is**: A picture of the webpage I started with.  
  - **Why Itâ€™s There**: A cool visual reminder of where it all began!  
- **Stored Stuff**:  
  - **What It Is**: The final version (after my edits) saved in a database called ChromaDB.  
  - **Why Itâ€™s There**: So I can search and pull it up anytimeâ€”like a digital bookshelf!

## How to Set It Up and Run It  
Want to try it yourself? Hereâ€™s how to get going:  

1. **Make a Home for It**:  
   ```bash
   mkdir book_publication_workflow
   cd book_publication_workflow
   ```

2. **Set Up a Safe Space**:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Grab the Tools**:  
   - Save the `requirements.txt` file, then run:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     playwright install
     ```

4. **Build the Folders**:  
   ```bash
   mkdir data data/raw data/processed data/screenshots src
   ```

5. **Add the Code**:  
   - Drop the script files into their spots (check the structure above).  

6. **Hit Play**:  
   - Run `python main.py`, and watch it work! Itâ€™ll:  
     - Grab the content.  
     - Let AI remix it tally.  
     - Ask if I want to edit (I can skip with Enter).  
     - Save it all for later.
