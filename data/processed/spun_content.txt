Behind him the breakers of the outer sea thundered and the spindrift scattered on the wind; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and flown about by the fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.
Clipped by its forty-mile ring of coral this great pond was a sea in itself, a whole.
And beneath the sea, a large, beautiful beach, a gigantic, sandy field and countless square acres and many hills.
But the deep-water waves had nothing to do with the beauty of the sea, nor did they play a part towards the sea.
